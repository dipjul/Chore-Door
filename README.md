# Chore-Door
Its a JavaScript based game, where we have the following features as the part of the game:<br />
1	Hiding behind one of these doors is the ChoreBot.<br />
2	Your mission is to open all of the doors without running into the ChoreBot.<br />
3	If you manage to avoid the ChoreBot until the very last door, you win!<br />
4	See if you can score a winning streak!<br /><br />

Any suggestion would be very helpfull.
